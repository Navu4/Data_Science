# Problem Statment

Our client is a credit card company. They have brought us a dataset that includes some demographics and recent financial data (the past six months) for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders. This data is at the credit account level; in other words, there is one row for each account (you should always clarify what the definition of a row is, in a dataset). Rows are labeled by whether in the next month after the six month historical data period, an account owner has defaulted, or in other words, failed to make the minimum payment.

Your goal is to develop a predictive model for whether an account will default next month, given demographics and historical data.You will developed the practical application of the model
